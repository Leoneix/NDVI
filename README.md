# Normalized Difference Vegetation Index Analysis


A widely used metric for quantifying the health and density of vegetation using sensor data.


# Objective
* Calculate NDVI from multispectral satellite data (e.g., Sentinel-2 or Landsat).

* Visualize spatial patterns in vegetation.

* Generate NDVI maps for analysis and reporting.

# Tools
* QGIS
* NIR band and RED band Satellite Imagery (from USGS EarthExplorer)

# Formula
NDVI = (NIR - RED) / (NIR + RED)

# Output
